Introduction

EsvmCompiler - optimizing compiler into bytecode virtual machine ExoSctript VM. Lets get class-file from Java like programming language.

What needs to happen in the end

After completion of the development, is supposed to be an optimizing Java compiler like programming language. Language will support all the basic paradigm of object oriented programming, and the compiler to be very platform independent.

The current state of development

Currently implemented language parser appropriate linguistic concepts theorem Böhm-Jacopini, which gene TAC IR. Implemented assebler being the builder class virtual machine files. At the moment there is a development of the translator TAC, in the assembly of the virtual machine.

Plans

After receiving the compiler functional programming language level, it is planned two parallel tasks. First necessary to do is to optimize the system. Since the first version of the compiler optimizations provided only domestic garbage collection. Second will have to evolve language in the direction of the object oriented programming.
